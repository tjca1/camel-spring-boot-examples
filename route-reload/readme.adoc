== Route Reload Example

This example shows how to use route reloading. This feature is watching a directory folder
for file changes, and then automatic trigger reload of the running routes in the Camel application.

The example generates messages using timer trigger, writes them to standard output.

=== How to run

You can run this example using

    mvn spring-boot:run

Then you can edit the `src/main/resources/camel/my-route.xml` file and save, to trigger
automatic reloading.
