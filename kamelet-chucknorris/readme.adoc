== Camel Example Kamelet Chuck Norris

=== Introduction

This example shows how you can build a simple Kamelet and use with your Camel applications.

The kamelet is created as a YAML file in the `src/main/resources/kamelets` directory.
We have developed a Chuck Norris Kamelet that periodically gets a joke from the Chuck Norris internet database.

A Camel routes is coded in Java in the `src/main/java/samples/camel/MyRoute.java` file
that uses the Kamelet, and log the result from the Kamelet to the console.

=== How to run

You can run this example using

    mvn spring-boot:run
